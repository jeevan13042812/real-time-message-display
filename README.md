🚀 Team Project Launch: IoT-based Real-time Message Display with ESP32 & Web Interface 🌐📲

Thrilled to share a collaborative project built by our 5-member team, where software meets hardware! 👨‍💻🔧

We developed a real-time system where: 💬 A message typed on a custom web interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) ➡ Is sent wirelessly over Wi-Fi to an ESP32 microcontroller ➡ Then displayed instantly on a 128x64 OLED screen 📟

🔨 Technologies Used: ESP32 WiFi Module

OLED Display (SSD1306)

Web Front-End (HTML/CSS/JS)

Arduino IDE

VS Code for Web Development

This was a full-stack hardware-software integration — from front-end design to embedded device communication.

👥 Team Members: Charan Singh (Web Developer + Embedded Integration)

Bharath Kumar Balagonda (ESP32 Programming)

Karthik Peddigani (UI Design)

Jeevan Avula (OLED Configuration)
